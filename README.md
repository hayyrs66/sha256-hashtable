# Employee Management System

This repository contains a simple implementation of an employee management system developed in Rust. The system allows registering basic employee information, such as name, employee number, and department. It utilizes a hash table (HashMap) to store the employee information and encrypts the employee number using SHA-256 before storing it as a key in the hash table.

## Usage

To run the program, make sure you have Rust installed on your system. You can compile and execute the program using the following command:

```bash
cargo run
```

The program will add some sample employees to the system and demonstrate the functionalities to search for an employee by their employee number and display information for all employees.
